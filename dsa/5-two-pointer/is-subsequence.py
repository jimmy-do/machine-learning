# is subsequence
# 
# Write a function, is_subsequence, that takes in string_1 and string_2. The function should return a boolean indicating
# whether or not string_1 is a subsequence of string_2.
# 
# A subsequence is a string that can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from another string.
